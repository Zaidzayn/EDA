📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Flight Price & Red Wine Quality Datasets
📝 Project Overview
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) work on two different datasets:

Flight Price Dataset

Red Wine Quality Dataset

The primary goal of this project is to perform in-depth EDA to extract meaningful insights, visualize relationships between features, detect outliers, and prepare the data for future machine learning tasks.

📌 Datasets Details
✈️ Flight Price Dataset
Columns include: Airline, Date of Journey, Source, Destination, Duration, Total Stops, Price, etc.

Focus: Understand the factors affecting flight prices through EDA.

🍷 Red Wine Quality Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Columns: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Alcohol, Quality, etc.

Focus: Analyze chemical properties influencing wine quality.

🔍 EDA Process Followed

Insights & Observations:

Key findings documented in the notebooks.

📊 Key Insights
✈️ Flight Price Dataset
Certain airlines charge significantly higher.

Total stops and journey duration show strong influence on price.

Weekend journeys often cost more.

🍷 Red Wine Dataset
Alcohol and sulphates show positive correlation with quality.

Higher volatile acidity tends to reduce quality.

Fixed acidity shows minimal influence.
